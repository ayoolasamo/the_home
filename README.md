The demo of this project can be seen on Netlify. It was a wonderful expreience creating this project as I learnt alot about the responsiveness of a webpage and i was able to gain more insights about react state and component. The project is strictly desiged for a desktop and tablet view as the mobile design of the webpage was not provided.
