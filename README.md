<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/ayoolasamo/the_home/blob/master/public/images/Screenshot.png)

The demo of this project can be seen on Netlify. It was a wonderful expreience creating this project as I learnt alot about the responsiveness of a webpage and I was able to gain more insights about react props and component. The project is strictly desiged for a desktop and tablet view as the mobile design of the webpage was not provided.

This web application has a functional navigation bar and various buttons which are not functional as a user story was not provided to tell about the destination of the buttons. Further more, the application has different sections providing various information.
